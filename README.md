A quick an easy way to get the weather forecast for Colorado's 14,000+ ft peaks.

This project uses the [Weatherbit.io API](https://www.weatherbit.io/api) to pull in the current weather and the forecasted weather. I've also integrated [Flickr's API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) to show pictures of each mountain.
