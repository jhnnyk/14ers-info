# 14ers.info

A quick an easy way to get the weather forecast for Colorado's 14,000+ ft peaks.

The home page presents a list of the Colorado 14ers. Clicking on one of these will take you to the page for that mountain.

Once on the mountain page, current weather is presented with the option to show the extended 16-day forecast as well as a detailed forecast in 3 hour increments. Photos from a Flickr photo search for the mountain name are displayed at the bottom of the page.

This project was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. It uses the [Weatherbit.io API](https://www.weatherbit.io/api) to pull in the current weather and the forecasted weather. I've also integrated [Flickr's API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) to show pictures of each mountain.
